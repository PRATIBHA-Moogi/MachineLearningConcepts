# MachineLearningConcepts

This is a repo holding simple exercises on 1. unsupervised learning methods 2. to be added supervised learning methods

### step 1 setup python working environment with all required pkgs installed before you start a jupyter notebook. Here requirements.txt holds all pkg versions dependencies to setup a working environment for you

```
conda create --name my-python-env  --file requirements.txt

```
#### Note in case you don't have conda installed then please install it 

```
Download window/mac specific versions from here:
https://docs.anaconda.com/miniconda/install/

```

### step 2 activate conda environment so that all pkg imports are referred from my-python-env python environment workspace - e.g. /Users/**/miniconda3/envs/my-python-env/bin/ and /Users/**/miniconda3/envs/my-python-env/lib/python3.12/site-packages/

```
conda activate my-python-env

```

### step 3 start jupyter notebook & open the given notebook & run it on your host machine

```
jupyter notebook

```
